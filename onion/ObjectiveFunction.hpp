 *
 *  The ObjectiveFunction is responsible for assigning a value to a solution of a problem.
 *
 *  All algorithms are, in essence, ways of navigating the solution space. In this metaphore,
 *  the ObjectiveFunction can be interpreted as the compass that poits towards the right direction.
 *  Its the objective function that tells the algorithm if a solution A is better or worse than a solution B.
 *
 *  The ObjectiveFunction class is an [ADT](@ref ABSTRACTDATATYPE) used to represent this
 *  concept and define the protocol of this functionality.
 *
 *  This is one of the fundamental components of the Onion Framework, the others being
 *  the CreateOperator, the PerturbationOperator and the SelectOperator.
