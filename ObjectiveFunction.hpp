 *  @brief Abstract Data Type that defines the ObjectiveFuntion component.
 *  @param solution_t the type used to represent a solution to a problem.
 *  @param objective_value_t the type used to represent the value of a solution.
 *
 *  In simple terms, ObjectiveFunction determines the value of a particular solution to a problem,
 *  based on the compact data used to represent a problem instance.
 *
 *  All algorithms are, in essence, ways of navigating the solution space. In this metaphore,
 *  the ObjectiveFunction is the compass that poits towards the right direction.
 *  It is the objective function that tells the algorithm if a solution **A**
 *  is better or worse than some other alternative **B**.
 *
 *  @note
 *  ObjectiveFunction is an <a href="./md__glossary.html#abstract_data_type">Abstract Data Type</a>.
 *  It means it provides no functionality and can't be instantiated.
 *  Instead, its purpose is to define unambiguously what "Objective" means in the framewok's context.
 *  Actual functionality will be defined later by concrete implementions in derived classes.
