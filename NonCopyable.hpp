 *  In many situations its not reasonable nor logical to let applications
 *  to create or set objects as copies of another objects.
 *  In terms os internal structure, this is usually the case of classes whose behaviour depends upon
 *  some internal state or of that encapsulate some kind of critical resource.
 *  Logically, this applies to objects that are suposed to be unique in some particular context.
 *  The later is the case of many components of the Onion Framework.
 *
 *  The purpose of the NonCopyable class is just to make this behaviour
 *  a little bit more simple to implement and evident to read.
